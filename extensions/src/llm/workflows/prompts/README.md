# Workflow Prompts

This folder contains markdown prompt templates used by various AI-driven workflows within the extension.

- Prompts are organized by workflow type (e.g., commit, plan, update).
- Each prompt file defines the specific instructions or inputs sent to the AI model during that workflow.
- Prompt files use markdown with fenced code blocks for clarity and structure.
- They include instructions such as file listing, content generation, and commit message creation.

These prompts serve as reusable templates driving AI interactions in committed workflows.
