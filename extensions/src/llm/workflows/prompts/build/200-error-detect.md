Analyze the following output:

Does this output indicate any errors?

- If there are errors, provide a numbered list of the affected full path source files (one per line, using their full paths as found in the files I provided).
- Take into account the possibility of a multi-project repository with nested subfolders; file paths may be relative to subfolders and should be reflected accurately.
- If there are no errors, respond with exactly: No errors detected.

Respond only with the numbered markdown list or that exact phraseâ€”do not provide explanations or extra commentary.
