# VS Code Configuration Folder

This folder contains Visual Studio Code configuration files and tasks to aid in development, testing, debugging, and packaging of the Aici extension and its related projects.

## Purpose

- Manage launch configurations to debug and run tests efficiently.
- Define and organize tasks for building, cleaning, watching, and packaging code across multiple packages.
- Centralize VS Code-specific settings such as AI model selections and workspace configurations.

## Key Files

- `launch.json`: Defines debugging profiles for running tests and launching the extension host.
- `tasks.json`: Defines reusable and composable build, clean, watch tasks per package and orchestrated workflows.
- `settings.json`: Contains workspace-level default settings, AI configuration, model selection, and ignores.

## Idiomatic Usage

- Use `npm run build` and `npm run watch` tasks to incrementally compile the extension and webviews.
- Use `task - watch` from VS Code tasks or debugging pre-launch to compile sources continuously.
- Use `task - clean` before builds for a fresh state.
- Use `npm run test` to run Jest tests via launch or task configurations.
- Keep secret keys out of `settings.json`; store secrets securely using VS Code SecretStorage.

## Best Practices and Design Rationale

- Version debug and task configurations to keep consistent developer experience.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets; enable secure key management.
- Compose tasks in sequence and parallel to optimize build workflows.
- Base debugging on the `extensionHost` profile with watch task pre-launch for rapid iteration.
- Use relative paths and exclude unnecessary files from builds and source watching.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not run tests or extension host without necessary build steps, as source maps and generated files are required.
- Avoid placing secrets in github-visible configs.
- Do not override the workspace `settings.json` with conflicting AI models or endpoints outside of the intended scope.
- Prefer using VS Code UI for managing secrets rather than manual edits.

## Helpful Commands

- Open Command Palette, run "Tasks: Run Task" and choose `task - watch` to start incremental build watch.
- Press `F5` to start debugging the extension with watch and proper source maps.
- Use "Run Test" launch config to execute tests in the extension.
